					<p>George Mason University’s School of Art is a collaborative academic and professional community focused on advancing creativity through traditional and new media applied to varying social contexts.</p>

					<p>The School of Art is founded on the premise that art both reflects and inspires a creative society, improving the human condition while describing the world, both as it is and could be.  We focus on the role of artists in that conversation.  We encourage students to see art both as individual expression and public interaction.  We celebrate historical reference, current relevance, experimentation –emphasizing innovative ways of thinking that enhance the impact of art on the future of society.</p>

					<p>Embedded in a major liberal arts university rich in learning resources, the School of Art plays a vital role in the creative climate of the institution and the region through the cross-disciplinary research it facilitates and the artwork it produces and exhibits. The School’s state-of-the-art facilities engage an exceptional faculty of practicing artists, an active visiting artist program, and a diverse and intellectually curious graduate and undergraduate student body. Artistic skills and principles of creative practice in all visual media are grounded in a forward-thinking, adaptive curriculum. Faculty and students forge cross-disciplinary experimentation, challenging conventional thinking and blurring lines between traditional artistic disciplines, indeed, between the arts and the other humanities and sciences.</p>

					<p>The School of Art educates artists and creative professionals to be responsible contributors to society, preparing them to be agents of change in an increasingly connected, complex, inclusive world.  We highly value rigor in conceptual approach, skill in art production, and imaginative methods for implementing projects and engaging audiences.  Each student is given a background in aesthetic and analytical judgment, the ethical framework for professional practice, the confidence to be both self-reliant and collaborative, and the mastery of design and production necessary to thrive as a professional artist in a competitive global environment.</p>

				<div class = "inforight">
					<p>Academic Advising in the School of Art at George Mason University is an integral part of the educational process. Academic advising helps plan educational goals and work to achieve them throughout a liberal arts education. The elements of that education include classes, co-curricular activities, work, and personal experiences. With interests and goals in mind, academic advisors will help formulate academic plans.  Advisors are dedicated to creating an atmosphere in which students can discover their potential, set and reach individual goals, explore and plan appropriate academic study, and prepare for success after graduation. The purpose of this syllabus is to show how to use the advising process at each step along the way.</p>

					<h3>Cancelling</h3>
					<p>Situations arise that may create a need to cancel/reschedule an appointment. You can cancel/reschedule your appointment through the online system, e-mailing avt@gmu.edu or calling (703) 993-8898. We ask you respect the advisor’s time by canceling appointments two hours in advance. </p>
					<h3>Appointment Policy</h3>
					<p>During peak advising periods, appointment times are at a premium. If you are more than 15 minutes late, you need to reschedule through the online system.</p>
					<p>If you do cancel an appointment two hours in advance, your absence will be noted as a “no-show.” Advisors will then give priority to students who keep their appointment times. Repeat offenders will not be able to schedule appointments until the end of the peak-advising season.</p>
					<h3>Preparation</h3>
					<p>-Be on time so the time during the advising appointment can be utilized efficiently!
					-Be prepared to discuss and explore course options, address academic problems or concerns, and make decisions about the upcoming semester.
					-Make a list of potential courses for the next semester you are interested in taking.
					-Explore your Degree Evaluation in PatriotWeb.
					-Make sure you arrive for your appointment on time.
					-Be prepared to take notes.</p>
